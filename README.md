# PhoneDirectory

- Implemented phone directory structure where we can import data by reading from csv file also has option to manually insert and delete the entries.
- Implemented merge sort on last name and first name.
- If found same name for multiple records, then used randomized quick sort on phone number.
- Implemented binary search for searching.
